# Prediction_of_marks_ML1
# To predict the marks of an student
->The first step is to import the libraries that are required for the implementation of the code operation.

->Here we import the Pandas to import and analyze data, NumPy to perform the multi-dimensionaloperation, and matplotlib to perform graphical plot into the context.

->The next phase is to load the data into the program to perform the desired operation. Here we use thepandas to load the excel data and when data is successfully loaded we print a statement  to getconfirmation.●Next is to view the data and so we are using the head() function. 

->The head function default view is thetop five, but again whatever you want to be in the number of views you can do it as entered, in this case,I have entered six views.

->The next phase is to enter distribution scores and plot them according to the requirement, here we aregoing to enter the title, x_label, and y_label, and show it according to the desired result.

->The process of dividing the data into attributes and labels is our next task, so we implement the same asbelow.●The split of data into the training and test sets is very important as in this time we will be using ScikitLearn's built in method of train_test_split().

# The very next process is to train the algorithm

->The very next phase is to implement the plotting test data using the previously trained test data●Predicting the scores for the model is the next important step towards knowing our model
